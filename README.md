For anybody who's made it, hi :D

### Using Git Remotes

This is me editing the README.md file remotely. Currently studying the ssh options.

After using the `git push -u origin git-remotes`, git created a new branch called `git-remotes` on my GitHub hello-world repo. It did not need any authentication which is interesting. At the time of writing there is no ssh setup between my machine and GitHub.
